The fourth section in the class provides an introduction to several topics. The main goal is to teach R markdown, but it does so within a concrete task: creating a website using blogdown and github. It is not assumed that the learner has any familiarity with these topics, so each one is introduced as it becomes relevant. The aim is to teach the core concept (R markdown) while providing initial exposure to other topics (especially git) that will become useful later.
