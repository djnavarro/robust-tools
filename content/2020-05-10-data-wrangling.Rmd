The third section in the class provides an introduction to data wrangling in R, mostly focusing on dplyr. Topics covered include: extracting a subset of the data, rearranging the data, computing new variables in a data set, merging multiple data sets, and pivoting data between "long" and "wide" forms. Including time to complete the in-class exercises, it usually takes about 4 hours.
