<p>The second module to the class is a bridging section. It introduces a data set (the reasoning data) that I’ll use later in the class, discusses reading data from and writing data to a CSV file, and introduces the pipe. Much of this section is devoted to a discussion of calculating “grouped summaries”. In the classroom I’ve found this takes about two hours to cover including all the practice exercises.</p>
