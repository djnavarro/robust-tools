The sixth section is also an [art class](functionality), this time focused on writing functions and using the functional programming toolkit in the purrr package. At the beginning the focus is on material for beginners: how to write a function and what the parts of a function are. Through the middle sections the discussion looks at how to write the functions necessary to make the "ashtree" system work, and how to organise those functions in a sensible way. The final sections provide an (minimal) introduction to purrr, and a (very) cursory discussion of scoping rules in R. Also it makes art!
