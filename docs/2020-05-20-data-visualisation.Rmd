The first "real" section of the class provides an introduction to data visualisation in R using ggplot2. It is also assumed to be the *first* contact a student has with R, so it covers a lot of the introductory topics like "what is an R commmand?", "how do I write a script?" and so on. It is intended to be hands-on, alternating between instructor-led content and student exercises. When teaching in-person, I have found this section takes about four hours to complete. As with other sections, it is designed so that you can do it without me: open up the slides and the RStudio Cloud project (both linked below) and then watch the YouTube videos; these will direct you to various hands on exercises you can do within the RStudio Cloud project.
