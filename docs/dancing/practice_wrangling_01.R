# Practice Exercise 1 is about reading a data set into R and cleaning the names.
#
# There is a file called "data_gutenberg100.csv" that contains the number of 
# daily downloads for the 100 most popular titles on Project Gutenberg for
# the date 2020-04-03. Your task is to read the data into R (as a tibble called
# "gutenberg"), and then to change the names of the three variables to be 
# "title", "author" and "download".
