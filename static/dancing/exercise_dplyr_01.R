# This is the blank file for dplyr exercise 1. Your job is:
#
# 1. Write the usual "this script is..." comment at the beginning
# 2. Have the script load tidyverse
# 3. Use read_tsv() to import the swow data into a data frame called "swow"
# 4. Add the "mystery" line... swow <- swow %>% mutate(id = 1:n())  
# 5. Use rename() to get new variable names:
#
# new names:     old names:
#   n_response     R1
#   n_total        N
#   strength       R1.Strength
