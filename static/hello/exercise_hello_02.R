# Exercise 2:
#
# The exercises from the visualisation module introduced you to the "forensic 
# handwriting" data published by Martire et al (2018). We'll work with these
# data for this exercise. Firstly we'll need to load the data and take a quick
# look at it but... oh no, more emojis. 
#
# I guess at this point I should confess that it's me who loves the emojis and
# not my daughter, who honestly is bored with this already. 
#
# In any case, your task is to replace the emojis with the appropriate R code
# and then briefly answer the discussion questions at the bottom (chat with 
# the person next to you!)


# Load the required packages
library(ðŸ’œ)

# Read the data into R
forensic <- ðŸ’…("data_forensic.csv")

# Inspect the data. The workshop showed two methods for doing this, printing
# and glimpsing the data. They can be useful for different purposes. Try 
# printing the data here:
ðŸ’…(ðŸ’œ)

# Now try glimpsing the data here:
ðŸ’…(ðŸ’œ)
 

# Discussion: 
#
# - How easy is it to work out what each variable "is"? Do we need something
#   else besides what I've given you so far?
#
# - I've used two emojis here instead of proper R code: ðŸ’… and ðŸ’œ. There's
#   a pattern to it... what is the difference between the "kinds of thing" that
#   I replaced with ðŸ’… and the kinds of thing I replaced with ðŸ’œ?
