# Exercise 4
#
# Okay, this is getting absurd. I know it's a pain, but my daughter is 
# really obsessed with emojis, and now she's replaced all the ggplot2
# functions with ðŸŽ¨. I'm really sorry about this, but could you please
# fix this for me so that it draws our pretty dinosaur picture?

# Our first script --------------------------------------------------------

library(tidyverse)

dino <- read_csv("data_dino.csv")
print(ðŸ’–)

# Create a new "picture"...
picture <- ðŸŽ¨(ðŸ™‚ = ðŸ’–) + 
  ðŸŽ¨(ðŸ™‚ = ðŸŽ¨(ðŸ™‚ = ðŸ’–, ðŸ™‚ = ðŸ’–))

# ... and plot it
plot(ðŸ’–)
