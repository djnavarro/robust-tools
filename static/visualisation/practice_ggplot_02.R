# Practice Exercise 02 
#
# The ggplot2 package comes with a data set called "economics" that includes
# information about the US unemployment rate from 1967 to 2015. Your task in
# this exercise is to draw a simple line plot using this data and "make it
# pretty". Here is a code snippet that should help you draw the basic plot:
#
# ggplot(
#   data = economics,
#   mapping = aes(
#     x = date, 
#     y = uempmed
#   )
# ) + 
#   geom_line()
#
# You should add a title, give the plot some readable axis labels, and change
# the theme to something nicer than the default. For full marks you should 
# change the y-axis limits so that the chart starts at 0. (You may need to 
# google to find the answer to this)
