# Practice Exercise 4. 
#
# Again, create a scatterplot using the mpg data that plots the city mileage 
# against the highway mileage; the colour of the dots should correspond to the 
# class of drive (e.g., compact). 
#
# For this exercise you should break the plot into separate facets, one for 
# each vehicle class. Make sure you add a sensible x-axis label, y-axis label
# and chart title. When you look at the resulting plot you should see that 
# it is redundant: the legend on the right hand side is unnecessary because
# the panels all have individual titles. See if you can get rid of the 
# legend entirely. (Hint: you may need to google to find the answer to this)
